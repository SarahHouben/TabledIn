// ###### Milestone 1 ######
// 1. Default welcome intent -  Create default welcome intent for each
// restaurant and continue conversation with restaurants agent
// 2. Intent - User makes reservation at restaurant
// Take date, time and number of people from user and check if there are free tables.
// 3. Permission - If there is free table ask permission to take user's name and number or email from google.
// 4. Intent - Create reservation - Once its confirmed there is table user confirms as well
// 5. Intent - Cancel the reservation - user can ask to cancel reservation at any time
// ######  Milestone 2  ######
// 6. Agent/Create - Create specific Agent during Restaurant creation and assign webhook that has restaurant
// id in the end
// ## if not possible create custom webhook link which you would use to manually create Agent
// inside dialogflow interface
// ###### MILESTONE 3 ######
// 8. Integration - Google phone service
// bonus: websocket for displaying reservations as soon as they are made
// bonus: Ask about day speciality
// bonus: Try to create reservation in his calendar
// bonus: Give user directions to restaurant
// rendering page at certain amount of time
// bonus: opening times
// Try to make conversations as human as possible - its a real person substitute
